## Scene Description
Our own "scene description language" made in Lua
  - University of Limerick, Computer Graphics II, Assignment 2
  - Multiple Lua modules:
    - proj02.lua: main file
    - lsd.lua: parser
    - query.lua: logic of solving and printing queries
    - numerous other modules for modularity
  - I tried to take an OO approach
  - We had to pass an automated test, so output formatting was fixed
  - All queries work except "visible", due to lack of examples and possibility to test on our own input
